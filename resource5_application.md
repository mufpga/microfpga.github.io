# Application examples



In the Ries lab, several microscopes are equipped with MicroFPGA together with [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) and [htSMLM](https://github.com/jdeschamps/htSMLM). In this section, we detail some aspect of our usage.

SCB: signal conversion board (see [electronics](electronics.md))

ACB: analog conversion board (see [electronics](electronics.md))



## GUI

Our microscopes are controlled through [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) and a custom [EMU](https://github.com/jdeschamps/EMU) plugin: [htSMLM](https://github.com/jdeschamps/htSMLM). Here is an overview of the mapping of the FPGA signals (device properties) in Micro-Manager to the htSMLM functionalities. Refer to the [htSMLM guide](https://github.com/jdeschamps/htSMLM/tree/master/guide) for more details, in particular the [descriptions](https://github.com/jdeschamps/htSMLM/blob/master/guide/using-htsmlm.md) of each panel.

Together, the GUI and MicroFPGA allows intuitive control of the microscope and automated localization microscopy.
