# Parts list

Here, we outline a simple part list with the main physical components needed to run MicroFPGA on a microscope.

- [Au](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16527)/[Au+](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17514) or [Cu](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16526) FPGA. The Cu does not have analog read-out channels, and is less powerful than the Au+.
- [Br break-out board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16524): allows easier access to the pins.
- [SCB board](resource1_electronics.md): to scale up/down signals and generate analog output signals.
- [ACB board](resource1_electronics.md): to scale down analog input signals to 0-1 V.
- 5 V external power supply soldered to the + and - of the FPGA board and to the power inputs of the servomotors.
