### TTL

TTL signals are often used to set a device on/off or in/out. A typical use are electronic flip-mirrors, in which a TTL low sets the mirror to its _out_ position, and a TTL high to its _in_ position. The module is simple and only has a single parameter:

| Parameter |           Value            |
| :-------: | :------------------------: |
|   State   | 0 (off, out) or 1 (on, in) |
